# Sales
In the most recent period, the Apocalypse Store realized $43.21 K in profit on 3,001 units sold, an average profit of $144.87 per unit driven principally by its top-selling SKUs (Multitool Survival Kit, Nylon Rope and Duct Tape), which together accounted for over 50 % of total profit. Geographically, sales were heavily concentrated in Texas, Florida and New York, with emerging demand in the Midwest suggesting an opportunity to diversify through targeted campaigns in Illinois and Ohio. Customer analysis further shows that just four repeat purchasers generated more than 65 % of profit, highlighting the potential impact of loyalty programs and volume-based incentives. To sustain growth, it is recommended to prioritize inventory and promotional support for high-margin products, bundle under-performing items with best-sellers, expand localized marketing efforts in under-penetrated regions, and introduce referral incentives to convert one-time buyers into long-term customers.
